# Setup Script Logs

This directory contains log files generated by the Windows setup script (`setup-windows.ps1`).

## Purpose

The setup script automatically creates detailed log files to help diagnose issues during dependency installation. These logs capture:

- System information (OS version, PowerShell version, user, etc.)
- All dependency check results
- Installation attempts and outcomes
- npm installation output and errors
- Detailed error messages with stack traces
- Timestamps for all operations

## Log File Format

Log files are named with timestamps: `setup-windows_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.log`

Example: `setup-windows_2025-01-15_14-30-45.log`

## Log Levels

Each log entry is tagged with a level:

- `[Info]` - General information about script progress
- `[Success]` - Successful operations
- `[Warning]` - Non-critical issues that don't prevent completion
- `[Error]` - Critical errors that cause failures
- `[Debug]` - Detailed diagnostic information (hidden from console)

## Using Logs for Troubleshooting

### For npm Installation Issues

The logs contain detailed npm output including:
- npm configuration (registry, cache, prefix)
- Full npm install output
- Specific error detection (permissions, network, node-gyp)
- Package counts and installation duration

### For Upload to Claude AI

When requesting help from Claude AI:

1. Locate the most recent log file in this directory
2. Upload the entire log file to Claude
3. Describe the issue you're experiencing
4. Claude can analyze the logs to identify:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Version conflicts
   - Build tool configuration issues
   - Network or permission problems
   - npm-specific errors

### Common Error Patterns

The script automatically detects and logs:

- **Permission Issues**: `EACCES`, `permission denied`
- **Network Issues**: `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENOTFOUND`, `network`
- **Build Tool Issues**: `gyp ERR!`, `node-gyp`

## Privacy Note

Log files may contain:
- Your Windows username
- Computer name
- File paths
- npm registry configuration

Review logs before sharing if you have privacy concerns.

## Log Retention

Logs are not automatically deleted. You may safely delete old log files to save disk space.
Each script run creates a new timestamped log file.
