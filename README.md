## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following main tables:

- **events**: Core timeline events with dates, descriptions, categories
- **eras**: Life phases/periods with color coding
- **tags**: Categorization tags for events
- **people**: People mentioned in events
- **locations**: Significant places
- **recording_queue**: Audio files awaiting processing
- **pending_events**: Extracted events awaiting user review
- **cross_references**: Relationships between events (RAG-generated)
- **app_settings**: Application configuration

Full-text search is supported via SQLite FTS5 virtual tables.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Windows 11 (primary target), macOS or Linux for development

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd memory-line
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Note: If you encounter Electron download issues in restricted environments, use:
   ```bash
   npm install --ignore-scripts
   ```

3. **Configure Anthropic API** (for LLM features):
   - Get an API key from https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Enter the key in Settings panel once the app is running
   - Keys are stored securely using OS-native credential storage

### Running the Application

**Development Mode**:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts both the webpack dev server and Electron in watch mode.

**Production Build**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run package
```

## Configuration

Settings are stored in the SQLite database and can be modified through the Settings panel or directly:

### Default Settings

```json
{
  "theme": "light",
  "default_zoom_level": "month",
  "audio_quality": "high",
  "llm_provider": "anthropic",
  "llm_model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "llm_max_tokens": "4000",
  "llm_temperature": "0.3",
  "rag_auto_run_enabled": "false",
  "rag_schedule": "weekly",
  "rag_similarity_threshold": "0.75",
  "send_transcripts_only": "true",
  "require_confirmation": "true"
}
```

### Audio Quality Settings

- **High**: 16kHz, 16-bit (recommended for best speech-to-text results)
- **Medium**: 8kHz, 16-bit
- **Low**: 8kHz, 8-bit

## Usage Guide

### Creating Events Manually

1. Click on the timeline or use the "New Event" button
2. Fill in event details (title, dates, description, category)
3. Add tags, people, and locations
4. Assign to an era (optional)
5. Save

### Recording Audio Memories

1. Navigate to the "Record" panel
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Speak clearly about the memory, including:
   - Dates and timeframes
   - Names of people involved
   - Locations
   - Significance of the event
4. Stop recording when finished
5. Preview the audio
6. Submit to queue for processing

### Managing Eras

Eras are life phases (e.g., "College Years", "First Job", "Living in NYC") that provide context and visual organization:

1. Open Settings → Era Management (planned)
2. Create new era with:
   - Name
   - Start/end dates
   - Color code (for timeline visualization)
   - Description
3. Events within the date range will be associated with the era

### Timeline Navigation

- **Zoom**: Use +/- buttons or scroll wheel
- **Pan**: Click and drag the timeline
- **Jump**: Use Previous/Next/Today buttons
- **Zoom Levels**: Year (3-year view), Month (3-month view), Week (3-week view), Day (7-day view)

### Search & Filter

- Use the search box for full-text search across titles, descriptions, and transcripts
- Filter by category, era, tags, people, or locations (UI pending)
- Date range filtering (UI pending)

## LLM Event Extraction

When audio recordings are processed, the system:

1. Transcribes audio using speech-to-text
2. Sends transcript to Claude with structured prompt
3. Extracts structured event data:
   - Title
   - Start/end dates
   - Description
   - Category
   - Suggested era, tags, people, locations
   - Confidence score
4. Presents extracted data to user for review
5. User can edit, approve, or reject
6. Approved events are added to timeline

### Extraction Prompt Template

The system uses a carefully crafted prompt that instructs Claude to:
- Extract factual information
- Preserve the user's voice
- Provide structured JSON output
- Include confidence scores
- Handle ambiguity gracefully

### Event Editing

Before approving extracted events, you can edit them:
1. Click "Edit" on any event in the Review Queue
2. Modify any field (title, dates, description, category, tags, people, locations)
3. Add or remove tags, people, and locations
4. Save changes to approve and add to timeline
5. Or approve without editing for quick workflow

## Speech-to-Text (STT) Configuration

The app supports multiple STT engines for audio transcription. Configure your preferred engine in Settings → Speech-to-Text Engine.

### Error Handling & Retry Logic

The app includes robust error handling:
- **Automatic retries** with exponential backoff for failed API calls
- **Up to 3 retries** for LLM extraction (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- **Up to 2 retries** for STT transcription (2s, 4s delays)
- **Detailed error messages** showing what failed and why
- **Database tracking** of failed items with timestamps
- **No retry** on authentication errors (401) or invalid requests (400)

## RAG Cross-Referencing

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system analyzes your entire timeline to find connections:

### Features (Planned)

- **Causal relationships**: Event A led to Event B
- **Thematic connections**: Similar themes or topics
- **Temporal patterns**: Recurring events or cycles
- **Person/location links**: Shared people or places
- **Tag suggestions**: Context-aware tagging based on entire timeline

### Privacy & Control

- **Explicit user consent required** - Never runs automatically without permission
- **Schedulable** - Set weekly/monthly automatic analysis (opt-in)
- **Manual trigger** - Run on-demand with confirmation dialog
- **Transparent** - Shows confidence scores and reasoning

## Data Privacy

- **Local-first**: All data stored locally in SQLite
- **No automatic cloud sync**
- **Selective API calls**: Only transcripts sent to LLM (configurable)
- **User confirmation**: Required for all LLM operations (configurable)
- **Secure storage**: API keys stored using OS credential manager
- **Audio retention**: Original recordings never deleted

## Performance Considerations

### Timeline Rendering

For large timelines (110+ years of data), the app uses:

- **Lazy loading**: Only loads events in current view range
- **Efficient queries**: Indexed date ranges in SQLite
- **DOM virtualization**: Renders only visible events
- **Memory threshold**: Keeps database < 132MB for in-RAM operation

### Database Size Management

- Regular vacuum to reclaim space
- Efficient blob storage for audio (external files, not in DB)
- Indexed columns for fast queries
- Full-text search virtual tables
