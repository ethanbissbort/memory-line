/// Composition root for the macOS app, mirroring the iOS companion's

/// launch and injected into the view tree with `.environment(_:)`.
///
/// The stores, sync client and Keychain come from the shared sources under
/// `ios-companion/MemoryLineCompanion/Shared/`, which the Xcode project
/// compiles into this target (see macos-native/README.md). The recorder,
/// uploader and status sync are macOS-specific rather than shared, because the
/// iOS versions are built on `AVAudioSession` and `BGTaskScheduler`, neither of
/// which exists here (`docs/design/MACOS-PORT-PLAN.md` §4). Their request
/// sequences and state machines are mirrored; only the scheduling differs.
///
/// Three things the phone does not have to think about, and this does:
///
///  - **A choice of input device.** Macs gain and lose inputs mid-session, so
///    `inputs` observes the hardware rather than reading it once.
///  - **Device display name** comes from the host name rather than
///    `UIDevice.current.name`.
///  - **No background execution.** The app is running or it is not, so the
///    loops are plain tickers started from `start()`.
