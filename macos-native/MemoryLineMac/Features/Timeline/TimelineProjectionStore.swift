///
/// They arrive inline because the contract denormalises them on purpose: a
/// consumer of a read-only projection draws a bubble rather than rebuilding a
/// relational graph, and syncing junction rows would multiply the change volume
/// to reproduce a join the consumer performs anyway. Junction tables here would
/// re-normalise data that arrived flat and then join it straight back on every
/// read. Three reasons beyond "it arrived that way":
///
///  1. **There is no independent write.** Windows republishes a whole event and
///     the local write is a full replace, so one upsert would become a DELETE
///     plus N INSERTs across three child tables — and it would have to be
///     atomic. `SQLiteDatabase` exposes no transaction on its public surface;
///     each statement takes the connection lock separately, so a concurrent
///     reader could observe an event with half its tags. One row, one statement,
///     one lock acquisition is not a shortcut here, it is the only shape that is
///     correct with the wrapper this app has.
///  2. **Nothing queries by tag.** What junction tables buy is an indexed
///     "events with person P" — a query the timeline does not make. The person
///     projection carries `eventCount` precisely so the People hub can sort
///     without touching the event table at all.
///  3. **The whole projection is a cache.** It is rebuilt by re-pulling the feed,
///     so this schema carries no migration debt. If a real by-tag query does
///     arrive, the honest answer is a derived index — a junction table
///     *maintained from* these columns, or `json_each`, which the system SQLite
///     provides — built beside the authoritative column rather than replacing
///     what is authoritative.
///
/// The cost, stated plainly: those four fields are opaque to SQL. Filtering by
/// tag today means a scan, and no constraint stops `personIds` naming a person
/// the feed has not delivered yet.
