/// Swift mirrors of the read-only timeline projections in
/// `shared-contracts/dotnet/MemoryTimeline.SyncContracts/TimelineProjectionContracts.cs`.
///
/// These are the `payloadJson` bodies of `event`, `era`, `person` and
/// `pending_event` sync changes. They decode through `SyncJSON.decoder`
/// (`Shared/Networking/DTOs.swift`): the wire is camelCase with no key strategy,
/// so the property names below *are* the wire names, and the timestamps are
/// ISO 8601 UTC with a variable number of fractional-second digits, which only
/// that decoder's custom date strategy accepts. Decoding one of these with a
/// stock `JSONDecoder` fails on every date in the payload.
///
/// **Direction.** Windows publishes, this Mac consumes. There is no merge policy
/// in this file and none is needed — a companion rendering a timeline from these
/// payloads holds a copy, not shared ownership. The only reconciliation is
/// last-write-wins on `updatedAtUtc`, which `TimelineProjectionApplier` applies.
///
/// **Optionality is the contract.** Every C# `?` is a Swift optional here and
/// every non-nullable C# property is non-optional, literally and deliberately.
/// The consequence is that a payload missing a required key fails to decode
/// rather than materialising a default: an event silently drawn at the Unix
/// epoch because `startDate` was absent is a far worse outcome than a change the
/// applier skips and logs by id, and Windows can always republish. The same
/// reasoning applies to the list fields, which are non-nullable C# collections
/// defaulting to empty — `System.Text.Json` writes them as `[]`, so an absent
/// key is a publisher bug, not a shorthand for "no tags".
///
/// **Privacy (§14.5).** These carry what a user reads on a timeline: titles,
/// dates, categories, names, and a bounded transcript excerpt. Nothing in this
/// file is ever logged; the applier and the store log ids and counts only.
///
/// **Not mirrored here:** `PendingEventDecisionPayload`. It is the one payload
/// that travels *toward* Windows, so it belongs with an outbox rather than with
/// the projections a companion consumes, and this Mac has no review surface to
/// author one yet.

/// One archived event, denormalised for drawing.
///
/// `tags`, `personIds` and `locations` arrive inline rather than as references
/// to junction rows. That is the contract's own choice, argued in
/// `TimelineProjectionContracts.cs`: a consumer of a read-only projection wants
/// to draw a bubble, not reconstruct a relational graph, and syncing junction
/// tables would triple the change volume to reproduce a join the consumer
/// performs immediately anyway. `TimelineProjectionStore` keeps them in the
/// shape they arrive in; the storage note there explains why.
