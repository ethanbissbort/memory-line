/// The Mac's microphone recorder: `MacAudioRecording` on top of `AVAudioEngine`,
/// writing 16 kHz mono 16-bit PCM WAV into `AudioStorage.recordingsDirectory()`.
///
/// It is a reimplementation of the iOS `AudioRecorderService`, not a port. The
/// iOS type is built around `AVAudioSession` — category, activation,
/// interruption and route-change notifications — none of which exists on macOS.
/// What *is* carried over verbatim is the persistence discipline (§8.4/§16.1),
/// because that is a durability contract rather than a platform detail:
///
///  1. the capture row is inserted in `.recording` state **before** the
///     microphone opens, so a crash mid-recording leaves a row that
///     `recoverAbandonedRecordings()` can finalise on the next launch;
///  2. `stop()` writes `.savedLocal` + byte length + SHA-256 + duration to the
///     store **before** it returns, so the record the caller receives (and the
///     upload pipeline picks up) is already durable;
///  3. `cancel()` removes both the partial file and the row, leaving nothing
///     for the upload pipeline or the recovery sweep to find.
///
/// ## Why `AVAudioEngine` and not `AVAudioRecorder`
///
/// `AVAudioRecorder` can be configured for LinearPCM and would produce a
/// conforming WAV with far less code, but on macOS it always records from the
/// **system default input** — there is no `AVAudioSession` to route it and no
/// device property on the recorder itself. Honouring `start(deviceId:)` with it
/// would mean changing the user's system-wide default input device, which is
/// not ours to change. `AVAudioEngine` exposes the input node's underlying
/// AUHAL audio unit, and `kAudioOutputUnitProperty_CurrentDevice` on that unit
/// selects the device for this process only. Device selection is the whole
/// reason the Mac seam has a `deviceId` parameter (port plan §4.1), so the
/// engine wins.
///
/// ## Why the format is fixed, and where it is enforced
///
/// The Windows side transcribes these recordings with Whisper, which parses
/// **only 16 kHz 16-bit PCM WAV** (`WhisperCompatibleFormats` is `.wav`, and
/// `WhisperSpeechToTextService` rejects anything without a RIFF/WAVE header).
/// The hardware almost never offers that format — a built-in Mac microphone is
/// typically 48 kHz float32 — so every tap buffer goes through an
/// `AVAudioConverter` into the target format before it reaches the file. The
/// `.wav` path extension is what makes `AVAudioFile` choose the RIFF container,
/// so the file name and the settings dictionary have to agree; both are derived
/// from `outputFormat` below.
///
/// ## Threading
///
/// Everything the UI reads is main-actor state on an `@Observable` class. The
/// audio callback runs on AVFAudio's own render thread and never touches this
/// object: it drives a `RecordingSink`, which converts, hands the converted
/// buffer to a serial writer queue, and publishes a level/frame count behind a
/// lock. The main actor samples that snapshot on a 20 Hz loop, exactly as the
/// iOS recorder samples `AVAudioRecorder`'s meters. No file I/O happens on the
/// main thread: writes ride the writer queue, and hashing runs on a detached
/// task.
