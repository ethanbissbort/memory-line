/// Main-window capture screen: record / stop, pause / resume, discard, a live
/// timer and input meter, and the input-device choice the phone never needs
/// (port plan §4.1).
///
/// Three shape decisions worth explaining:
///
///  - **A grouped `Form`, not the iPhone's hero button.** The iOS screen is one
///    huge round button because it is used one-handed at the wheel. The Mac
///    screen has to carry a device picker and a capture-type default alongside
///    the transport, and a grouped form is how this app already renders that
///    kind of surface (`PairingSettingsView`). The transport still sits in the
///    first section, large and prominent.
///  - **Dependencies arrive through the initializer as `any` existentials over
///    the seam protocols** (`CaptureSeams.swift`), plus the shared
///    `SettingsStore` for the two preferences this screen owns. Nothing here
///    names a concrete recorder, enumerator, or `MacAppEnvironment`, so this
///    file compiles and reviews before any of them exist, and a test or preview
///    can pass a stub. `@Environment(SomeType.self)` would have required a
///    concrete observable type to already exist.
///  - **It never touches the upload pipeline.** `MacAudioRecording.stop()`
///    persists the capture as `.savedLocal`; driving it to the server is
///    `MacUploading`'s job, wired at the composition root. A view that also
///    poked the uploader would give two owners to one transition.
