        var prompt = $@"You are an expert at extracting structured event information from transcribed speech. Your task is to analyze the following transcript and extract all mentioned events with their details.

# Instructions:
1. Identify ALL events mentioned in the transcript (meetings, milestones, accomplishments, significant occurrences)
2. For each event, extract:
   - Title (concise, descriptive)
   - Description (detailed information from the transcript)
   - Start date (parse relative dates like 'yesterday', 'last week', 'two months ago')
   - End date (if the event has duration)
   - Date precision (one of: exact, day, month, season, year, decade, unknown)
   - Category (one of: {categoryList})
   - Tags (relevant keywords)
   - People involved (names mentioned)
   - People details (for each person: their name, their relationship to the speaker if stated, and any other noteworthy details mentioned about them)
   - Locations mentioned
   - Confidence score (0.0 to 1.0 based on clarity of information)
   - Source text (the exact portion of transcript about this event)
   - Reasoning (brief explanation of why you extracted this as an event)

3. Parse dates relative to: {referenceDate:yyyy-MM-dd}
4. Be thorough but only extract genuine events, not hypotheticals or general discussions
5. Assign confidence scores based on:
   - 0.9-1.0: Explicit dates and clear details
   - 0.7-0.9: Clear event with approximate dates
   - 0.5-0.7: Event is clear but dates are vague
   - Below 0.5: Uncertain or ambiguous
6. Set datePrecision to the COARSEST unit actually justified by the transcript. NEVER guess a specific day when the speaker was vague:
   - exact: an explicit date AND time of day were stated
   - day: a specific calendar day is known
   - month: only the month and year are known (""in March 2019"") - set startDate to the 15th of that month
   - season: only a season is known (""that summer"") - set startDate to the middle of the season
   - year: only the year is known (""sometime in 2011"") - set startDate to July 1 of that year
   - decade: only the decade is known (""back in the 90s"") - set startDate to the middle year of the decade
   - unknown: no usable date information at all

Return a JSON object with this exact structure (no markdown, just raw JSON):
