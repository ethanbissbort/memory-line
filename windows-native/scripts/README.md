# Memory Timeline - PowerShell Scripts

This directory contains PowerShell scripts for setting up, verifying, and managing the Memory Timeline Windows native application (.NET 8 / WinUI 3). This is the **primary, actively developed** version of Memory Timeline.

## Build Reality (Important)

Before using the commands in this document, note the following about the current build:

- **Build with Visual Studio 2022 or `msbuild`, not `dotnet build`.** The WinUI 3 app uses the Windows App SDK PRI generation task, which fails under `dotnet build`. Use `msbuild` (from a Developer Command Prompt / Developer PowerShell) or build/run from Visual Studio.
- **The solution is x64-only.** `MemoryTimeline.sln` defines only `Debug|x64` and `Release|x64`. Always pass the platform explicitly, e.g. `-p:Platform=x64` (msbuild) or select `x64` in Visual Studio. There is no `Any CPU` or `Win32/ARM64` solution configuration.
- **.NET SDK is pinned by `../src/global.json`** to version `8.0.100` with `rollForward: "major"`. This means a .NET 8 SDK (8.0.100+) or a newer major SDK such as .NET 9 will both satisfy the pin. `dotnet restore` still works normally for package restore.

Example command-line build/restore/test (from a Developer PowerShell in `windows-native/src`):

```powershell
# Restore packages (dotnet is fine for restore)
dotnet restore MemoryTimeline.sln

# Build the WinUI 3 app with msbuild (NOT dotnet build)
msbuild MemoryTimeline.sln -p:Configuration=Debug -p:Platform=x64 -restore

# Run unit tests
dotnet test MemoryTimeline.Tests\MemoryTimeline.Tests.csproj
```

> Note: `Setup-Dependencies.ps1` prints a "Next steps" hint suggesting `dotnet build` and `dotnet run --project MemoryTimeline`. That hint is **stale/inaccurate** for the WinUI 3 app — prefer Visual Studio or `msbuild` with `-p:Platform=x64` as shown above.

See [`../TESTING.md`](../TESTING.md) for the full, primary test suite instructions.

## Scripts

### Setup-Dependencies.ps1

### Verify-Installation.ps1

Verifies that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.

**Usage:**

```powershell
# Basic verification
.\Verify-Installation.ps1

# Detailed information
.\Verify-Installation.ps1 -Detailed

# Export report to file
.\Verify-Installation.ps1 -ExportReport
```

**What it checks:**

**System Requirements:**
- Windows version (11 21H2+)
- System RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- Free disk space (10GB+ recommended)
- CPU information

**Development Tools:**
- .NET SDK (8.0+)
- Visual Studio 2022 (17.8+)
- Windows SDK (10.0.22621.0+)
- Windows App SDK (1.5+)
- Git
- PowerShell (5.0+)

**Optional Tools:**
- Windows Package Manager (winget)
- Visual Studio Code
- MSIX Packaging Tool

**Application:**
- Memory Timeline MSIX package installation

**Features:**
- ✓ Comprehensive dependency verification
- ✓ Version checking
- ✓ Detailed component information
- ✓ Pass/Fail/Warning status for each check
- ✓ Summary statistics
- ✓ Optional report export
- ✓ Exit codes for CI/CD integration

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: All checks passed
- `> 0`: Number of failed checks

## Common Scenarios

### First-Time Setup (Developer)

```powershell
# 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
# 2. Navigate to scripts directory
cd memory-line\windows-native\scripts

# 3. Run setup script
.\Setup-Dependencies.ps1 -Mode Development

# 4. Verify installation
.\Verify-Installation.ps1 -Detailed

# 5. Open Visual Studio and build
cd ..\src
start MemoryTimeline.sln
```

### Production Runtime Setup

```powershell
# 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
# 2. Navigate to scripts directory
cd memory-line\windows-native\scripts

# 3. Install runtime dependencies only
.\Setup-Dependencies.ps1 -Mode Production

# 4. Verify installation
.\Verify-Installation.ps1
```

### Troubleshooting Installation Issues

```powershell
# 1. Check what's missing
.\Verify-Installation.ps1 -Detailed

# 2. Re-run setup to fix missing components
.\Setup-Dependencies.ps1 -Mode Development

# 3. Export detailed report
.\Verify-Installation.ps1 -Detailed -ExportReport

# 4. Check verification-report.txt for details
notepad verification-report.txt
```

### CI/CD Integration

```powershell
# In your CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.)

# Verify environment
.\scripts\Verify-Installation.ps1
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    Write-Error "Dependency verification failed"
    exit 1
}

# Build and test (x64-only; use msbuild for the WinUI 3 app, not dotnet build)
cd src
dotnet restore MemoryTimeline.sln
msbuild MemoryTimeline.sln -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=x64 -restore
dotnet test MemoryTimeline.Tests\MemoryTimeline.Tests.csproj --configuration Release
```

## Manual Installation

If automatic installation fails, you can install components manually:

### .NET 8 SDK

### Visual Studio 2022
Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Required workloads:
- .NET desktop development
- Universal Windows Platform development

## Script Permissions

If you encounter execution policy errors:

```powershell
# Check current execution policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# Temporarily bypass for current session
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

# Or set for current user (more permanent)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Getting Help

For issues with the scripts:

```powershell
# View script help
Get-Help .\Setup-Dependencies.ps1 -Full
Get-Help .\Verify-Installation.ps1 -Full

# View examples
Get-Help .\Setup-Dependencies.ps1 -Examples
```

## Notes

- **Administrator privileges required**: Both scripts require admin rights to install components and modify system settings
