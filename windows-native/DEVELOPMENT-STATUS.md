## iOS roadtrip companion — Phase 1: sync service & Windows sync client (2026-08)

**Date:** 2026-08-07

Phase 1 of the iOS roadtrip companion plan (design doc section 19; see the
Phase 0 entry below for the groundwork it builds on) landed:

- **Sync service** — new `services/MemoryTimeline.SyncApi` (ASP.NET Core,
  net8.0; unlike the WinUI solution it is plain cross-platform .NET and
  builds/tests/runs with the `dotnet` CLI). Self-hosted Mode A server
  (design §4.2): device pairing/registration gated by an owner pairing code,
  self-issued HMAC-SHA256 JWT access tokens with refresh-token rotation and
  immediate revocation (§14.1); idempotent capture metadata ingestion
  (replaying a `captureId` returns the existing capture); chunked artifact
  upload (initiate → PUT parts → complete with byte-length/part-count/SHA-256
  validation, §11.4) into a filesystem artifact store; and an append-only
  `sync_changes` log serving cursor-based `GET /sync/pull` (own-device echo
  suppression), per-device idempotent `POST /sync/push` (push receipts keyed
  on client sequence), and `POST /sync/ack`. SQLite metadata + artifact blobs
  live under one configurable data directory. Operator guide:
  [`../services/README.md`](../services/README.md).
- **Windows sync client** — new `MemoryTimeline.Sync` project in the WinUI
  solution. `SyncBackgroundWorker` runs a periodic (30 s) pull → apply →
  ack → publish-outbox loop; `RemoteChangeApplier` turns each pulled capture
  change into artifact download + idempotent `ICaptureIngestionService`
  ingestion, so a remote audio capture enters the existing review queue
  **exactly once**; `LocalOutboxPublisher` drains the Phase 0 `sync_outbox`
  in order to `/sync/push` and marks accepted/duplicate rows delivered. The
  cursor only advances past applied/skipped/permanently-failed changes;
  retryable failures stop the pull and retry next cycle. Settings → Sync UI:
  server URL + pairing code, enable/disable, sync-now, status line, and
  unpair/revoke. New `SettingKeys.Sync*` constants (server URL, device ID,
  tokens, cursor, auto-process); wire DTOs shared with the service via
  `shared-contracts/dotnet/MemoryTimeline.SyncContracts` (camelCase JSON,
  `JsonSerializerDefaults.Web`).
- **CI** — new Linux workflow `.github/workflows/sync-api-build.yml` builds
  `services/MemoryTimeline.Services.sln` and runs the SyncApi test suite with
  the dotnet CLI on `ubuntu-latest`; the Windows workflow now also triggers
  on this branch and on `shared-contracts/dotnet/**` changes.

**Exit criterion status:** implemented and integration-tested at the service
level — a test client can register, create a capture, upload its audio
artifact, and the Windows pull → ingest path dedupes it into review exactly
once. End-to-end validation against a real iPhone awaits the Phase 2 iOS
client.

**Known follow-ups (from the post-fix verification pass):**

- The `RefreshTokenHash` concurrency token applies to every device-row update;
  ack/revoke racing a concurrent refresh can surface a retryable 500 (only
  refresh has reload-and-retry today).
- Crash-orphaned `*.tmp` assembly files in the service's artifact store are
  never swept (in-process failures clean up after themselves).
- The register endpoint reads the `Idempotency-Key` header directly and does
  not enforce the 128-char limit the authenticated-route filter applies.
- Service schema is `EnsureCreated` (no migrations); pre-release upgrades
  across schema changes require deleting `sync.db` (see services/README.md).
- Sync tokens are stored in the Windows app's settings table like the other
  keys; DPAPI-at-rest remains the tracked hardening follow-up.
- Per the resolved design §22 decisions (2026-08-07): the service needs an
  artifact retention sweep (delete artifacts 14 days after Windows
  acknowledges archival, or sooner under storage pressure) — artifacts are
  currently retained indefinitely.

**Design decisions:** all §22 open decisions were resolved by the owner on
2026-08-07 — self-hosted only, no user accounts (pairing-code device model),
Windows-local transcription (GPU/NPU when available), optional on-device iOS
Whisper, Google places within the free tier with informed Apple failover,
CarPlay screens designed for v1 with the entitlement deferred (Siri/widget/
Action Button carry the in-car experience), 14-day artifact retention after
archival ack, pending transcripts excluded from the assistant unless
explicitly included via UI, 14-day route-context retention. See the design
doc §22 for the full records.

**Next step:** Phase 2 — iOS capture MVP (SwiftUI shell, one-touch recording,
durable local queue, background upload, capture history/status).

## iOS roadtrip companion — Phase 0: contract & schema groundwork (2026-08)

**Date:** 2026-08-06

Phase 0 of the iOS roadtrip companion plan (a separate track from the app phases
below; see
[`../docs/design/IOS-ROADTRIP-COMPANION-SYSTEM-DESIGN.md`](../docs/design/IOS-ROADTRIP-COMPANION-SYSTEM-DESIGN.md),
section 19) landed:

- **Device-neutral capture schema** — new `captures`, `capture_artifacts`, and
  `sync_outbox` tables (EF models, `AppDbContext` configuration, idempotent
  `SchemaUpgrader` DDL); `recording_queue` extended with device-neutral
  provenance columns (`source_capture_id` **unique**, `source_device_id`,
  `source_platform`, `audio_artifact_id`, `original_file_name`,
  `content_sha256`, `sync_state`, `received_at`, `processing_stage`).
- **Idempotent ingestion service** — `ICaptureIngestionService` /
  `CaptureIngestionService`: resolves artifacts via `IArtifactResolver`
  (Phase 0: local files), verifies declared byte length + SHA-256, dedupes by
  source capture ID (including the insert race), and writes capture + artifact +
  queue item + sync outbox record in **one atomic SaveChanges**
  (`ICaptureRepository.IngestAsync`).
- **Queue processing stages** — `QueueService` now stamps
  `ProcessingStage`/`SyncState` through the pipeline (transcribing,
  review_ready/completed, failed_configuration, failed_retryable), gained
  `ProcessCaptureAsync`, and resets items to pending on cancellation.
- **Shared API contracts** — new `shared-contracts/` directory:
  `openapi/memory-line-sync-v1.yaml` (Sync API v1 skeleton) and
  `json-schema/capture-envelope.v1.json` (remote capture ingestion envelope);
  Swift/C# clients will be generated from these (see `shared-contracts/README.md`).

Existing Windows recordings pass through the new ingestion abstraction with no
UI behavior change (the Phase 0 exit criterion).

**Next step:** Phase 1 — sync service (device registration/auth, capture
metadata + artifact upload, cursor-based push/pull) and the Windows sync worker
that drains the new `sync_outbox`.

## 2026-08 feature-spec implementation (F1–F12)

**Date:** 2026-08-06

Twelve features from the Memory Timeline feature spec were implemented on top of the
post-audit base, in dependency-ordered waves (F1/F3/F4 → F2/F7/F5 → F8/F6/F9 →
F11/F12/F10) with a verification fix pass after each wave. Every wave pushed CI-green
(`Release|x64`, `windows-latest`).

**Per-feature status (all landed):**

- **F1 — Date precision & uncertainty:** `DatePrecision` enum
  (Exact/Day/Month/Season/Year/Decade/Unknown) + `earliest_possible`/`latest_possible`
  window on `events` and `pending_events`; precision-honest date display everywhere;
  extraction assigns precision instead of inventing days; the category list bug fixed.
- **F3 — Text/paste capture:** `recording_queue.source_type` (Audio/Text/Imported),
  persisted `transcript` reused across retries (also for Whisper output), Ctrl+Shift+V
  paste-capture dialog on the Queue page.
- **F4 — Ask your timeline:** new Ask page; hybrid keyword+semantic retrieval merged
  with reciprocal-rank fusion; grounded answers cited to real events; honest refusal
  when nothing relevant exists; keyword-only degraded mode without embeddings.
- **F2 — Media attachments:** `event_media` table, managed copy tree under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MemoryTimeline\Media`, EXIF via MetadataExtractor, thumbnails,
  content-hash dedupe, lightbox, drag-drop.
- **F7 — On This Day / Home:** new default landing page; precision-aware anniversaries
  (only Exact/Day events surface on a specific day); event view tracking; optional
  daily toast; `event:` deep links fixed; first-run empty state.
- **F5 — Narrative generation:** grounded prose per scope (range/era/person) with
  precision-honest dates and code-enforced citation integrity; Markdown/HTML export;
  story dialog reachable from Eras, Timeline, and People.
- **F8 — Spans/swimlanes/uncertainty + perf:** duration span bars, collapsible
  swimlanes, uncertainty band rendering; scroll reload coalescing (major timeline
  performance fix).
- **F6 — Guided recall prompts:** `recall_prompts` table; five gap sources (density
  gaps, dangling people, era edges, thin events, anniversaries); deduped against all
  prior prompts so a question is never re-asked; cards on Queue and Home.
- **F9 — People hub:** `person_aliases`, tombstone merges (`people.merged_into_id`),
  case-insensitive NOCASE identity with a defensive migration that merges case-variant
  duplicates and backfills contact columns; person profiles; alias-aware extraction.
- **F10 — Offline map:** coordinates on `locations` (EXIF GPS backfill + pin drop),
  opt-in Nominatim geocoding **off by default**, fully offline canvas map (deliberately
  **not** WinUI `MapControl`/Azure Maps).
- **F11 — Pluggable AI:** local ONNX `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings (384-dim, CPU EP) —
  local-first Connections with no OpenAI key; OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint support
  (Ollama/LM Studio); per-call provider routing (`RoutingLlmService`/
  `RoutingEmbeddingService`); embedding dimension guard + re-embed flow; per-session
  LLM usage counter.
- **F12 — Backup/restore/revisions:** `.mtbak` online-backup archives (optionally with
  media), restore with preview + explicit confirmation, append-only `event_revisions`
  history + history dialog, scheduled daily/weekly backups, and a real Clear Cache.

**Infrastructure fixes in the same wave:** the SQLite pragma interceptor no longer
rewrites `journal_mode` on read-only connections; CI triggers on the feature branch;
`app_settings` seed parity is three-way (33 keys, `AppDbContext` seed = `SchemaUpgrader`
backfill = `SettingKeys`).

**Explicitly deferred (not implemented, by design):** PhotoImportPage bulk-import
wizard; map tile basemaps (the map is a plain offline canvas); a location chip on
timeline events; real LLM token streaming (responses arrive whole); PDF narrative
export (Markdown/HTML only); vertical scrolling within swimlanes; reorderable lanes;
an EXIF test against a real binary image fixture; a Merge restore mode (restore is
replace-only, with a pre-restore safety backup); DirectML execution provider for the
ONNX embedder (CPU is used).

**Honest caveats:** all of the above is code-complete and CI-green, but **runtime
validation on a real Windows machine is still pending** — none of the new features have
been exercised end-to-end outside tests. The **EF migration baseline has still not been
regenerated**; every schema addition above ships through `SchemaUpgrader`'s idempotent
DDL, and API keys remain plaintext in `app_settings` (DPAPI still a follow-up).

## Post-audit hardening (2026-07)

**Date:** 2026-07-10

Between the Phase 6 "feature-complete" milestone and the start of formal Phase 7
testing, three live user-reported bugs (Save on Add Event did nothing; searching
for the added event showed a "search error"; the timeline Refresh button showed
nothing) triggered a **multi-agent feature audit and fix pass**. Five specialized
agents traced every major feature end-to-end (UI → command → ViewModel → service →
repository → SQLite → UI) with file:line evidence. The full findings are in
[`FEATURE-AUDIT.md`](FEATURE-AUDIT.md); deferred items are tracked in
[`HARDENING-FOLLOWUPS.md`](HARDENING-FOLLOWUPS.md).

**What the audit found (root causes):**

- **A category string case mismatch + swallowed errors** — the Add Event dialog
  fell back to `"Other"` (capital O) while validation checked case-sensitively
  against lowercase categories, throwing before any DB write; the exception was
  reduced to a status-text log line and the dialog had already closed. This alone
  produced "Save does nothing" (Bug 1) and, downstream, "Refresh shows nothing"
  (Bug 3, because no row was ever inserted).
- **One app-wide shared, never-disposed `AppDbContext`** — every page resolved its
  ViewModel from the root provider, so a single Scoped context served the whole
  app. Overlapping operations (e.g. a fire-and-forget embedding task racing an
  un-debounced per-keystroke search) threw "a second operation was started on this
  context," surfaced as the "search error" (Bug 2) and intermittent failures
  across features.
- **Mic-based STT that ignored the recorded file** — the speech-to-text path loaded
  the WAV into an unused variable and then transcribed the live microphone, so the
  core audio ingestion loop never processed the actual recording.

**What was fixed in this pass:**

- Category-casing fallback normalized and validation made case-insensitive; Add
  Event dialog now uses a deferral and surfaces errors in-dialog instead of
  silently closing.
- Data access converted to **per-operation contexts** via
  `IDbContextFactory<AppDbContext>`; the shared-context `Task.Run` for embeddings
  removed/rescoped; search input debounced/cancellable; `Tag.Name`→`TagName`.
- Startup now uses `SchemaUpgrader.EnsureSchemaAsync` (EnsureCreated + idempotent
  drift repair); stale EF migrations were deleted (regenerating a real migration
  baseline is a follow-up).
- STT replaced with **local Whisper** (Whisper.net, ggml base model, offline after
  first model download), transcribing the recorded file instead of the live mic.
- Atomic approve (event + tags/people/locations in one transaction) with timeline
  auto-refresh; settings key writer/reader unified under a `SettingKeys` constants
  class; embeddings settings-key + provider/dimension wiring; RAG mapped-column
  queries + persistence + `IsAvailable`; export `Include` fix; unified
  `INotificationService`; navigation param overload; dead
  `AnthropicClaudeService`/`IAudioService` deleted.
- A **CI Windows-build workflow** was added
  (`.github/workflows/windows-native-build.yml`) that builds `Release|x64` on
  `windows-latest` and runs the test suite.

**Outcome / honest current state:** the solution **builds green in CI** on a
Windows runner, but **end-to-end runtime validation is ongoing** — this is **not
yet production ready**. The audit work resolved the three reported bugs at the code
level and removed the shared-context foundation defect underneath them; the
remaining Phase 7 work is runtime verification plus the follow-ups listed below.

**Build reality (important for anyone building locally):**

- The solution is **x64-only** (no AnyCPU configuration).
- WinUI 3 PRI generation needs **Visual Studio `msbuild.exe`**; `dotnet build`
  fails with **MSB4062**.
- `global.json` pins the **.NET 8 SDK** with `rollForward: "major"`.
- CI (`windows-native-build.yml`) builds `Release|x64` on `windows-latest` and runs
  tests.

**Immediate follow-ups (see `HARDENING-FOLLOWUPS.md`):** end-to-end runtime
validation; DPAPI encryption of API keys at rest; regenerate the EF migration
baseline; Whisper model/language options; analytics export; MSIX packaging +
Microsoft Store submission; update tests still using the old constructor signatures
to the context factory.

## Phase 7: Testing & Deployment - 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Status: In Progress
**Current Focus:** End-to-end runtime validation of the post-audit hardening fixes,
followed by comprehensive automated testing, performance validation, packaging, and
store submission.

**Done so far in Phase 7:**
- Multi-agent feature audit + fix pass (see "Post-audit hardening (2026-07)" above and
  `FEATURE-AUDIT.md`) — resolved the three reported user bugs at the code level and
  removed the shared-context foundation defect.
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/windows-native-build.yml` added: builds `Release|x64`
  on `windows-latest` and runs the test suite. **The solution builds green in CI.**

**Still ahead:** end-to-end runtime validation on real hardware; regenerating the EF
migration baseline; updating tests still on the old constructor signatures; performance
validation; MSIX packaging + code signing; Microsoft Store submission.

### Objectives

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for all services
   - Integration tests for database operations
   - UI tests with WinAppDriver
   - Performance tests with large datasets

2. **Performance Validation**
   - Timeline rendering at 60 FPS with 5000+ events
   - Memory usage < 100 MB for 5000 events
   - Cold start time < 2 seconds
   - Database query performance < 50ms

3. **MSIX Packaging**
   - Package manifest configuration
   - App icons and assets (all sizes)
   - Code signing with EV certificate
   - Dependencies bundling

4. **Microsoft Store Submission**
   - Store listing preparation
   - Screenshots (1920×1080, 2560×1440)
   - App description and keywords
   - Privacy policy
   - Age ratings

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Runtime validation:** The post-audit fixes *and* the entire F1–F12 feature wave
   build green in CI but are not yet validated end-to-end on real hardware (Phase 7,
   in progress)
2. **Automated tests:** Some older tests still use the old constructor signatures and
   need updating to the `IDbContextFactory` pattern; broad coverage still pending (Phase 7)
3. **EF migrations:** Stale migrations deleted; a real migration baseline still needs
   regenerating — all 2026-08 schema additions ship via `SchemaUpgrader.EnsureSchemaAsync`
4. **API keys:** Stored in plaintext; DPAPI encryption is a follow-up
5. **Performance:** Not yet validated with 5000+ events (Phase 7)
6. **MSIX Package / Store Submission:** Not created or submitted yet (Phase 7)
7. **ONNX acceleration:** The local embedder runs on the CPU execution provider;
   DirectML/NPU registration is deliberately deferred (can throw on non-DX12 machines)
8. **PDF Export:** Not implemented — narrative export ships Markdown/HTML only
9. **Deferred F1–F12 items:** See the deferred list in the 2026-08 section above
   (photo-import wizard, tile basemaps, token streaming, Merge restore mode, etc.)

### Future Enhancements
1. **DirectML/NPU execution** for the local ONNX embedder (currently CPU)
2. **Advanced Timeline Features:** Filtering, advanced search from timeline
3. **Pattern Visualization:** Charts and graphs for detected patterns
4. **More Embedding Models:** Voyage AI, Cohere, alternative local ONNX models
   (local `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and OpenAI are implemented)
5. **Performance Optimization:** Caching, lazy loading, pagination for very large datasets
6. **PDF Export:** Using WinUI 3 printing APIs
7. **Cloud Sync:** OneDrive/Dropbox integration (optional)
8. **Collaborative Features:** Shared timelines, multi-user support

## Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

These reflect the real post-audit follow-ups (see `HARDENING-FOLLOWUPS.md`).

1. **End-to-end runtime validation**
   - Run the app on real Windows hardware and exercise each fixed flow
     (add event → search → refresh; record → local Whisper STT → LLM extract →
     approve → timeline; embeddings/connections; export/import; settings persistence).
   - Confirm the three reported bugs are gone at runtime, not just in code.

2. **Data-layer / migrations**
   - Regenerate a real EF migration baseline (stale migrations were deleted; startup
     currently uses `SchemaUpgrader.EnsureSchemaAsync`).
   - Update tests still using the old constructor signatures to the `IDbContextFactory`.

3. **Security & config hardening**
   - Encrypt API keys at rest via DPAPI / `ProtectedData`.
   - Add Whisper model/language options; wire up analytics export.

4. **Testing & performance baseline**
   - Set up xUnit structure, in-memory/test DB, first EventService tests.
   - Generate test datasets (100/1000/5000 events) and measure baseline metrics.

5. **MSIX & Store**
   - Design app icons/assets, write privacy policy, configure Package.appxmanifest,
     code-sign, and prepare the Microsoft Store submission.
